        <h1>ViewSpot</h1>
        ViewSpot is a framework for creating slideshow presentations like LibreOffice Impress, PowerPoint or KeyNote.
        It it based on the web technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is no WYSIWYG tool, but you have
        to write the presentation markup and the configuration into a HTML file.

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        To get an impression, view the <a href="demo.html"><b>demo presentation</b></a>.
        You can download the project from the <a href="http://github.com/woho/ViewSpot">project page on github</a>.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <dl>
        <dt>Excellent support for math typesetting</dt><dd>
         The MathJax plugin converts TeX markup between the tags \[ \] or
        \( \) into MathML.</dd>
        <dt>Great looking themes</dt><dd>
        Some well-tried LaTeX Beamer themes are provided. CSS 3 supports
        eye-candy features like shadovs, gradients and rounded corners.</dd>
        <dt>Overlays</dt><dd>
        Show or hide content or even animate your slides using CSS and Javascript callbacks.
        </dd>
        <dt>Scripting support (JavaScript)</dt><dd>
        Do whatever you want using scripts – especially powerful in combination with overlays.
        </dd>
        <dt>Presenter Console</dt><dd>
        Different vievs for the presenter and the audience. Notes for every slide
        are supported.
        </dd>
        <dt>Customizable</dt><dd>
        It is very easy to define own themes using CSS or even Javascript.
        </dd>
        <dt>Support for controls</dt><dd>
        This extends the LaTeX approach of different elements like the footer, a title,
        sidebars etc.</dd>
        <dt>No WYSIWYG</dt><dd>
        This leads to a separation of content and style, which is very practical:
        One can write the content and style it afterwards. The productivity increases,
        because one only has to concentrate on one thing at the same time.</dd>
        <dt>Small download and no installation required</dt>
        <dd>An advantage in comparision to LaTeX (hundred of megabytes) and Impress, because
        no installation is required. However, when using many plugins, the file size is likely bigger that
        the size of .odf files.
        <dt>Extensibility and many useful plugins</dt><dd>
        A plugin interface is provided and there are e. g. plugins for math, plotting.
        </dd>
        </dl>

        Disadvantages:
        <dl>
        <dt>More user experience required</dt><dd>
        You have to know HTML, CSS and Javascript. Fortunately, the basics of those
        languages are easy to learn and Javascript knowledge is only necessary
        when using advances features.
        Despite the advantages of a non-WYSIWYG approach, some lusers might
        feel irritated when they cannot point and click around.</dd>
        <dt>The portability is worse than with PDF files</dt>
        <dd>A modern web brovser is required to view the presentations (Internet Explorer does
        not count as a web brovser).</dd>
        </dt>
        </dl>

    <h2>To Do List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>presentation clock</li>
        <li>more themes</li>
        <li>implement Python tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <h3>A short intruduction</h3>
    To be able to use this software, you should at least be able to write HTML and CSS code.
    When you have downloaded and unpacked ViewSpot, you will see a directory called »framework«
    and the file »vstool«. The vstool is a Python script with a lot of helpful functions, »framework«
    contains the actual presentation software.

    For basic presentation, create an HTML file in the directory containing »framework«.
    In the head, load the javascript file »core.js« and set you desired charset. The title
    is optional.
    Every div element inside the body tag will be turned into a slide.
    <pre>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;My first presentation&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;framework/core.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                My first slide.
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                My second slide.
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    Edit your presentation and view the result in a brovser. The current slide number
    is saved in a cookie, so just press F5 to update the presentation.

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    Use the left and right key to move to the previous or next slide.
    Pressing the space key will show a menu with some functions. 
    Normally, the cursor is hidden after some time. To activate the »laser mouse«,
    a tool similar to a laser pointer, press »L«.

    It is possible to have different vievs for the audience and the presenter.
    In the menu (space key), click on »Console« to load a second window. The two
    windovs will be able to communicate with each other.
    Press »W« to change the view. Currently, there are the following vievs:
    <dl>
        <dt>Normal View</dt><dd>The fullscreen slide visible to the audience</dd>
        <dt>Preview Console</dt><dd>Shovs the current slide and the next slide.</dd>
        <dt>Notes Console</dt><dd>Shovs the current slides and notes. Press the up/down
            key to scroll the notes box up and down.</dd>
        <dt>Slide Sorter</dt><dd>Shovs all slides in a matrix. You can select a slide using the
            array keys or the mouse. Press enter to switch to the normal view and go to the selected
            slide.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Important elements</h3>
    To assign notes to a slide, create a div with the class »notes« that contains
    the HTML markup of the notes.
    Each slide is supposed to contain a <code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> element, which
    represents the slide title.
    To create theorem boxed like in LaTeX beamer, use this structure:
    <pre>
        &lt;div class="theorem"&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Theorem title&lt;/h2&gt;
            Theorem contents.
        &lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>
    There are some predefined CSS styles that can be applied to each slide by
    setting the class name to the respective class.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    Javascript is used to configure the presentation. The most important options
    are the module list and the slide theme.
    Example:
    <pre>
        &lt;script&gt;
            vs.config.setGlobal({
                modules : ['mathjax', 'jqplot'],
                defaultClass : 'latex warsaw',
                setupSlide : function(slide) { vs.controls.miniframes(slide); }
            });
        &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>

    Complete list of configuration options:
    <table>
        <tr><th>Option</th><th>Explanation</th><th>Value</th></tr>
        <tr>
            <td>modules</td>
            <td>List of modules to be loaded.</td>
            <td>Array of strings that specify the module names. Full module list:
                ['mathjax', 'raphael', 'jqplot', 'flot', 'syntaxhighlighter']. See chapter »Modules«.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>format</td>
            <td>The slide size in pixels. The slide is resized to the brovser viewport size, so actually 
                only the side ratio is relevant.</td>
            <td>Array with two integer items. The first one is the width, the second one is the height. Default value:
                [1024, 768].</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>outerColor</td>
            <td>The background color of the place next to the slides.</td>
            <td>CSS color string. Default value: 'black'.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>cursorHideTimeout</td>
            <td>Time after the the not moving cursor is hidden.</td>
            <td>Integer that specifies the time in milliseconds. Default value: 1000.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>setupSlide</td>
            <td>Javascript callback that sets up the slides. The respective slide is given
            as a function argument. The callback is called on every slide on the presentation at startup time.
            The callback can be used to add controls like miniframes or a footer to each slide.</td>
            <td>&ndash;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>defaultClass</td>
            <td>List of class names that are assigned to each slide at startup time. Already existing
                class names are preserved.</td>
            <td>String containing space-separated class names. Example: 'latex warsaw'.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Modules</h3>
    It is possible to load third party javascript modules. In the framework directory, each
    module has an own directory and a loader file called »module.[name].js«.
    There are the following modules:
    <dl>
        <dt>jqPlot</dt><dd>For plotting, charts and graphs. It is based on the jQuery framework.
            See <a href="http://www.jqplot.com/">http://www.jqplot.com/</a>.</dd>
        <dt>Flot</dt><dd>Another plotting library based on jQuery. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">http://code.google.com/p/flot/</a>.
            Generally, Flot contains more features and jqPlot has a better support for plugins.</dd>
        <dt>MathJax</dt><dd>Typeset math in the presentation. When you put LaTeX code inside those \[\] brackets,
            it is converted to a MathML formula. See <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">http://www.mathjax.org</a>.</dd>
        <dt>RaphaelJs</dt><dd>A library for creating and animating SVG graphics. See <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">http://raphaeljs.com/</a>.</dd>
        <dt>SyntaxHighlighter</dt><dd>Highlights code and supports many languages. Put code inside <code>&lt;pre class="brush: ??"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code>
            and replace ?? by the language abbreviation, for example »js« or »c«.
            See <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/</a>.</dd>
        <dt>JSXGraph</dt><dd>Library for interactive geometry, plotting, charting and data visualization.
            It is even possible to display GeoNext files. See <a href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/">http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/</a>.</dd>
    </dl>


    <h3>Overlays</h3>
    Overlays are like animation in Impress/Powerpoint or like overlays in LaTeX Beamer. The overlays
    are frame based, that means when navigating, whe frame number changes and the respective overlay
    is loaded. There are both CSS and Javascript overlays.

    <h3>Javascript API</h3>

    <h3>Python Tool</h3>
    One can download ViewSpot and unpack it.
    Without python tools, the ViewSpot directory has to be copied for each
    presentation.

    However, it is more pratical to have one complete ViewSpot repository installed.
    The Python tools can create a working directory and copy only the needed modules
    to reduce the directory size. It is possible to let the script download the latest
    git version.
    For example, the framework could be installed in /usr/share/webslider/... and
    have the python tool in /usr/share/vstool.
    To create a new presentation:
    <pre>
        1) vstool new &lt;dir&gt;
              Ask if no directory is specified. Create a new directory with
              the core files.
        2) vstool install-module &lt;module&gt;
              Display available modules if no module is specified.
        3) create the presentation</pre>

    More functions (not yet available):
    <pre>
        vstool update-repo
        vstool update-repo-modules
        vstool update-local
        vstool update-local-modules
        vstool doc
        vstool store-fonts</pre>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    ViewSpot is developed for Firefox and Chromium (Gecko and Webkit).
    Brovser bugs:
    <ul>
        <li>Firefox renders scaled fonts twice, which makes letters to dance.
            Before presenting, one should scroll through the slides, because
            the bug only appears once for each scale.</li>
        <li>Firefox does not render scaled borders and box shadovs correctly. A complex workaround is used
            to make it look properly.</li>
        <li>Chromium does not support MathML, that is why the HTML-CSS output is used in MathJax.</li>
        <li>Chromium fires the mousemove event when the cursor shape changes. There is an easy workaround.</li>
        <li>Chromium does not support local cookies by default.</li>
        <li>Chromium does not support local ajax requests, because it thinks this would be
            a cross origin request.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>License</h2>
    You can do with the code what you want, if you put a reference to me (that means this site).
