        <h1>WebSlider</h1>
        WebSlider is a framework for creating slideshow presentations like LibreOffice Impress, PowerPoint or KeyNote.
        It it based on the web technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is no WYSIWYG tool, but you have
        to write the presentation markup and the configuration into a HTML file.

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        To get an impression, view the <a href="demo.html"><b>demo presentation</b></a>.
        You can download the project from the <a href="http://github.com/woho/WebSlider">project page on github</a>.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <dl>
        <dt>Excellent support for math typesetting</dt><dd>
         The MathJax plugin converts TeX markup between the tags \[ \] or
        \( \) into MathML.</dd>
        <dt>Great looking themes</dt><dd>
        Some well-tried LaTeX Beamer themes are provided. CSS 3 supports
        eye-candy features like shadows, gradients and rounded corners.</dd>
        <dt>Overlays</dt><dd>
        Show or hide content or even animate your slides using CSS and Javascript callbacks.
        </dd>
        <dt>Scripting support (JavaScript)</dt><dd>
        Do whatever you want using scripts â€“ especially powerful in combination with overlays.
        </dd>
        <dt>Customizable</dt><dd>
        It is very easy to define own themes using CSS or even Javascript.
        </dd>
        <dt>Support for controls</dt><dd>
        This extends the LaTeX approach of different elements like the footer, a title,
        sidebars etc.</dd>
        <dt>No WYSIWYG</dt><dd>
        This leads to a separation of content and style, which is very practical:
        One can write the content and style it afterwards. The productivity increases,
        because one only has to concentrate on one thing at the same time.</dd>
        <dt>Small Download and no installation required</dt>
        <dd>An advantage in comparision to LaTeX (hundred of megabytes) and Impress, because
        no installation is required. However, when using many plugins, the file size is likely bigger that
        the size of .odf files.
        <dt>Extensibility and many useful plugins</dt><dd>
        A plugin interface is provided and there are e. g. plugins for math, plotting.
        </dd>
        </dl>

        Disadvantages:
        <dl>
        <dt>More user experience required</dt><dd>
        You have to know HTML, CSS and Javascript. Fortunately, the basics of those
        languages are easy to learn and Javascript knowledge is only necessary
        when using advances features.
        Despite the advantages of a non-WYSIWYG approach, some lusers might
        feel irritated when they cannnot point and click around.</dd>
        <dt>The portability is worse than with PDF files</dt>
        <dd>A modern web browser is required to view the presentations (Internet Explorer does
        not count as a web browser).</dd>
        </dt>
        </dl>

    <h2>To Do List</h2>

        <li>more themes</li>
        <li>improve mozilla shadow fix</li>
        <li>speedup module loading</li>
        <li>implement Python tools</li>
        <li>invent a better project name</li>
        <li>store the fonts in the presentation and use css font-face (good idea?)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <h3>A short intruduction</h3>
    <h3>Javascript API</h3>
    <h3>Python Tool</h3>
    One can download WebSlider and unpack it.
    Without python tools, the WebSlider directory has to be copied for each
    presentation.

    However, it is more pratical to have one complete WebSlider repository installed.
    The Python tools can create a working directory and copy only the needed modules
    to reduce the directory size. It is possible to let the script download the latest
    git version.
    For example, the framework could be installed in /usr/share/webslider/... and
    have the python tool in /usr/share/wstool.
    To create a new presentation:
    <pre>
        1) wstool new &lt;dir&gt;
              Ask if no directory is specified. Create a new directory with
              the core files.
        2) wstool install-module &lt;module&gt;
              Display available modules if no module is specified.
        3) create the presentation</pre>

    More functions (not yet available):
    <pre>
        wstool update-repo
        wstool update-repo-modules
        wstool update-local
        wstool update-local-modules
        wstool doc
        wstool store-fonts</pre>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    WebSlider is developed for Firefox and Chromium (Gecko and Webkit).
