Interesting ideas:
* provide Python scripts that do important tasks:
    - select only the files needed for the presentation
    - (unimportant) compress these files into a single html file for easy transport
        - pictures can be stored base64 encoded in html
        - other files are included as javascript strings?
        - canvas needed for font-face
    - reduce file size by removing whitespaces
    - encode all videos to both h264 and ogg/webm for browser support
* diagrams with SVG
    - Raphael library
    - matplotlib
    - own tool?
* program to make the presentation portable:
    - store the fonts in the presentation and use css font-face
    - download all pictures

* compatibility to at least the newest Firefox, Chrome, Opera, (IE, Safari)
* compatibility to older browser versions?

WebSlider is primarily developed using Firefox, that means here the compatibility is best.
